    Mass incarceration represents a public health and social issue in the U.S, particularly, the high levels of
    recidivism are concerning.
    According to the <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/recidivism-core-criminal-justice-concern"> National
      Institute of Justice</a>, more than 60% of the prisoners released in 2005 were arrested
    within 3 years and 83% within 9 years.
    <br>
    <br>
    In an effort to further study and address this problem, we examine the rates of recidivism
    across several social dimensions such as mental illness prevalence,
    family conditions, emotional difficulties and education, using the data from the BJS 2016 Inmates Survey.
