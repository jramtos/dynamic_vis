    Mass incarceration represents a public health and social issue in the U.S, particularly, the high levels of
    recidivism are concerning.
    According to the <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/recidivism-core-criminal-justice-concern"> National
      Institute of Justice</a>, more than 60% of the prisoners released in 2005 were arrested
    within 3 years and 83% within 9 years.
    <br>
    <br>
    In an effort to further study and address this problem, we examine the rates of recidivism
    across several social dimensions such as mental illness prevalence,
    family conditions, emotional difficulties and education, using the data from the BJS 2016 Inmates Survey.

          Inmates with Any Mental Illness show higher number of arrests.

          The following graph shows the average arrested times across different age groups.
          So in general, younger groups have higher rates of arrests, which is no surprise (See Cook and Laub 1998).
          The main point of this graph is how the curves corresponding to inmates with serious and non-serious mental
          illness are evidently higher of those inmates who reported no mental illness.
          And the differences are wider if we only look at the female population with any serious mental illness.

          This is relevant because less than half of the inmates who report a mental illness, have received any
          treatment in jail or prison,
          and the rate is lower for inmates that continue to receive treatment (BJS 2016 Inmates Survey), which is
          concerning as all prisoners have a constitutional right to health care.
          Additionally, the high levels of arrests for inmates with a mental illness highlight the need to improve
          the access to mental health services as it might prevent further arrests and incarceration.

        Analyzing other mental health dimensions and family conditions.

        Important to note that in the survey, inmates voluntarily shared information about their mental health and
        diagnosed with mental illness by an MD.
        People that live in high-risk conditions, like most of the prison population, are also less likely to have
        access to medical resources (i.e. medical appointments, health care treatments),
        and so the likelihood of being diagnosed by an MD is lower as the access to health care is lower. This
        implication is relevant because in the data we only see voluntary reported and diagnosed mental illnesses.
        Hence, another variable to look at is emotional distress and how this affects recidivism. Also,
        criminological theories have long suggested that family relationships influence
        criminal behavior. In this sense, we study several family conditions of the inmate like being in foster care,
        having a family member in prison, being homeless in the past, and being homeless before turning 18.
